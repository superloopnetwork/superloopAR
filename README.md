# superloopAR

Inspired by Facebook's FBAR, superloopAR (Auto Remediation) is an application that acts as a robot which constantly scans through syslog messages and auto remediates any issues in the network without human intervention.

The current syslog directory is set to /mnt/syslog/

How to use:

Simply execute 'python main.py' in bash.

I will improve and re-code this application to improve structure as time permits.
